# DarkAcademiaWeb
The project includes a page in the theme of the aesthetic trend "Dark Academy". On this page the user will be able to learn more about the trend itself sign up for the newsletter and contact the owner of the site.

## Page execution report

-The website was designed in the style of "Dark Academy" and includes the following subsections: "Home", "About us", "Newsletter" and "Contact".
-The website has been optimized for responsiveness, which means that its appearance and functionality are automatically adjusted to the resolution and size of the screen on which it is displayed. This makes the site readable and easy to use on both desktop computers and mobile devices.
-In the "Newsletter" section, form validation has been implemented using JavaScript. This allows checking whether the data entered by the user is correct and meets certain requirements, such as the correct format of the email address.
-A "paralel scroll" mechanic has been implemented on the site, which allows the content to scroll smoothly.
-A map from Google Maps has been added to the "Contact" section, allowing users to easily locate the company's headquarters (the London library is currently set).
